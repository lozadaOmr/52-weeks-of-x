### Day 0: January 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
- Started with FreeCodeCamp's Basic Javascript course 
- While additional material from [How to Learn JavaScript Properly](http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly/)

**Thoughts:** 

As much as I want to get started doing advanced stuff. Might be good idea and get my hands dirty working with the basics. And oh, hello semi-colon my old friend.

### Day 1: January 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
- Continued with FreeCodeCamp's Basic Javascript course 

**Thoughts:** 

I still prefer Python's if/else statements. But already gotten used to ending statements with semi-colon. Took some time on those exercises in between topics that requires some additional code work.

### Day 3: January 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
- Moved to Object Oriented and Functional Programming course (JavaScript) 

**Thoughts:** 

Got confused at first on how `array.map();` and `array.reduce();` works
Probably due to not having previous knowledge of functional programming

```
finalVal = array.reduce(function(previousNum, currentNum) {
  return previousNum + currentNum;
}, 0);
```

### Day 7: January 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
- Continued FreeCodeCamp's Basic Algorithm Scripting course

**Thoughts:** 

Got stuck for awhile not noticing that I had typo error on my code. Was pretty sure that when I tried it out on chrome console it was working, and was unsure why it wasn't when running the test on FCC.

```
var str.lenght;
> undefined
```

### Day 9: January 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
- Continued FreeCodeCamp's Basic Algorithm Scripting course
- With more focus on Array exercises

**Thoughts:** 

Took a long time to complete "Seek and Destroy".

Can't help but still think in Python where `destroyer([1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3], 2, 3);` 
and `function destroyer(arr) {};` to which in Python you would simply just `def destroyer(arr, *args):`
 
Had to really take a look at the documentation and read.

Also noticed I tend to 'misuse'? `Array.prototype.filter()` always
thought of it as a pseudo for loop.

Got stuck on Wherefore art thou, because I misunderstood the requirement.
Quick glance on the expected result. I assumed immediately that is would be an array containing an object `[{a,b,b}]` which looked like flattened.

After rereading carefully examining the inputs and the expected output, managed to come up with a less complicated solution.
