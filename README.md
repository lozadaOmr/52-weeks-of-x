# I've started the year with 52 Weeks of Engineering

In 2017 particiated in [#100DaysOfCode](https://github.com/lozadaOmr/100-days-of-code) while this challenge is more focused on coding. But this time learning not just about coding but also other aspects of software engineering


Think of this as my holistic approach to learning.
